Count the identical pairs in two lists
# credit https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57144684/count-the-identical-pairs-in-two-lists
My list has

a = [1,2,3,4,2,7,3,5,6,7]
b = [1,2,3,1,2,5,6,2,6,7]
I need to count if a[i]==b[i].

For the above example, the answer should be

6
Detail description of answer is

a[0]==b[0] (1==1)
a[1]==b[1] (2==2)
a[2]==b[0] (3==3)
a[4]==b[4] (2==2)
a[8]==b[8] (6==6)
a[9]==b[9] (7==7)
sum(x == y for x, y in zip(a, b))
